# Stock Price Forecasting with Time Series Analysis

A statistical approach to stock price prediction using ARIMA and SARIMA models, applied to Google (GOOGL) stock data for educational purposes.

## üìä Project Overview

This project explores time series forecasting techniques for stock price prediction using classical statistical models. The analysis focuses on Google stock data and implements both ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) models to understand price patterns and make short-term forecasts.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

**This project is strictly for educational and experimental purposes only.**
- Not intended for actual trading or investment decisions
- Stock markets are highly unpredictable and influenced by countless factors
- Past performance does not guarantee future results
- Always consult with financial professionals for investment advice

## üõ†Ô∏è Models Implemented

### ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- Captures trends and autocorrelations in stock price data
- Parameters: p (autoregressive), d (differencing), q (moving average)
- Suitable for non-seasonal time series data

### SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
- Extension of ARIMA that handles seasonal patterns
- Additional parameters: P, D, Q (seasonal components), s (seasonal period)
- Better for data with recurring seasonal patterns

## üìà Dataset

- **Stock**: Google (GOOGL)
- **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance
- **Time Period**: [Add your date range]
- **Features**: Close

## üîß Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Key Libraries**:
  - `pandas` - Data manipulation and analysis
  - `numpy` - Numerical computations
  - `matplotlib` / `seaborn` - Data visualization
  - `statsmodels` - Statistical modeling (ARIMA/SARIMA)
  - `sktime` - Statistical modeling (AutoARIMA)

## üìã Prerequisites

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn statsmodels jupyter sktime yfinance plotly datetime
```


## üìä Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Load Google stock data
   - Handle missing values and outliers
   - Data type conversions and indexing

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Price trend visualization
   - Statistical summaries
   - Stationarity testing (ADF test)

3. **Data Preparation**
   - Differencing for stationarity
   - Train-test split
   - Data scaling if needed

4. **Model Building & Selection**
   - ARIMA parameter tuning (p, d, q)
   - SARIMA parameter optimization
   - Model comparison using AIC/BIC

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Forecast accuracy metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE)
   - Residual analysis
   - Model diagnostics

6. **Forecasting & Visualization**
   - Generate future predictions
   - Confidence intervals
   - Forecast vs actual comparison plots

## üìà Key Findings

*[Add your specific findings here, for example:]*
- ARIMA(p,d,q) model showed [performance metrics]
- SARIMA captured seasonal patterns with [accuracy]
- Model performs better for short-term forecasts (1-7 days)
- Limitations observed in volatile market conditions

## üîç Model Performance

*[Include your model evaluation results:]*
- **ARIMA Model**: MAE: X.XX, RMSE: X.XX, MAPE: X.XX%
- **SARIMA Model**: MAE: X.XX, RMSE: X.XX, MAPE: X.XX%

## üìù Lessons Learned

- Stock prices exhibit complex patterns difficult to capture with simple statistical models
- External factors (news, market sentiment) significantly impact price movements
- Time series models work better for short-term rather than long-term forecasting
- Model validation is crucial for assessing real-world performance

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- Incorporate external variables (sentiment analysis, economic indicators)
- Experiment with machine learning models (LSTM, Prophet)
- Implement ensemble methods combining multiple models
- Add risk management and portfolio optimization components
